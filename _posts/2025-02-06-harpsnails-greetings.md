Harp Snails and Greetings

Hey everyone, it’s Kay and Ele here with another cozy little update to the world of Pyria!


**Harp Snails: A New Magical Creature**

Back near the start of the AI wave, DALL-E launched with a wave of art that mixed ideas like “an avocado chair” into visual form. But as we scrolled, “a snail made of harp” was an instant favorite—and that’s how the magical Harp Snail came to life! These little creatures have quickly become an integral part of the world of Pyria. Each of the four regions has its own variation of the Harp Snail, and they each sing unique songs as they travel through the world. When you encounter one, you can be sure you want to go where they’re headed!


**NPC Greetings**

Kay only had a few minutes to add something before bed today, but that was enough time! He figured out how to make the inhabitants of Castle City say something when you click on them. If they are given many lines, they will say them in sequence. There is support for more complicated dialogue trees, but before we explore that, the next step is to make it possible for our characters to move around Castle City and go about their day.


**Ele’s Progress on Castle City & Character Organization**

Meanwhile, Ele’s been busy shaping up Castle City. It’s time to make sure our NPCs have places to live and thrive! She’s also been diving into character documentation and organizing different classes—preparing the groundwork to bring this world to life in all its depth. Every detail is important, and we’re excited to continue building out the world you’ll explore.


Keep following along as we continue to build this magical world from the inside out.

Until next time,

Kay & Ele
