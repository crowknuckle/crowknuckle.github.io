**Another Day, Another Step Closer to Pyria!**

It’s been a cozy couple of days as we celebrated Ele’s birthday, but we still played on Pyria! Even if it’s at a bit of a slower pace... Every step counts!

**Kay’s Big Navigation Update**
Kay made some more adjustments to the navigation system in Pyria. He had been working on fixing nav without a nav mesh, but sometimes the best solutions are the simplest. Instead of continuing down a time-consuming road, he shifted gears and implemented navigation invokers. This is not the ideal solution, but it cut down on map load time enough that we can keep going!

**Pyria’s Map**
We’re really excited to introduce the official map of Pyria! It’s a work in progress, but it’s starting to come together. Ele’s been designing this map, both inside Unreal Engine and out on paper, for quite some time, and we’re loving how it’s shaping up. While there’s still plenty of fine-tuning to do, the world is starting to feel like something tangible—and that’s a major milestone for us.

**What’s Next for Pyria?**
We’ll be focusing on more of these subtle tweaks and big-picture systems in the coming days. It’s all about getting the core feel of the world right before we dive deep into the more intricate details. The adventuring is about to get started!

Pyria is more than just a game—it’s the world we’ve always wanted to explore together, and we’re excited to share it with you. More updates coming soon, so stay tuned!

Until next time,

Kay & Ele
