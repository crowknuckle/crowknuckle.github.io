title: Ancient Hunters of The North - Building Pyria's Legends
---

Today we're excited to share more about the mysterious creatures that stalk Pyria's frozen wastes. While catching up from the holiday season, we've been quietly crafting some of our most ambitious features yet.

The Laviini: Terror of The Frozen Tundra
Beneath Pyria's snow-covered plains, something ancient lurks. Today we're thrilled to reveal more about the Laviini - the legendary ice wyrms that have haunted northern tales for generations. These massive predators embody winter's savage heart, hunting in packs through the frozen wastes.
Ele spent hours detailing the Laviini's lore, ensuring these creatures feel as real and terrifying as the blizzards they command. Like everything in Pyria, the Laviini aren't just monsters - they're part of an intricate ecosystem. Their hunt of the mammoth herds shapes the very culture of the Northern Rangers, who risk everything to protect their charges from these frozen horrors.

Tools of Creation
Meanwhile, Kay has been working his coding magic on our NPC creation system. With just a click, we can now breathe life into new characters who will populate our world. It's amazing how a few lines of code can lay the foundation for thousands of future stories. With time of the essence, every saved second counts. 

The Road Ahead
47 days remain in our journey to launch. Sometimes it feels surreal - building this dream in the quiet hours after our day jobs, piece by piece, monster by monster. But every new feature, every character, every creature like the Laviini, makes Pyria feel more real. More like home.
There's still so much to share about what we've been working on during our posting break. Stay tuned - the secrets of Pyria are just beginning to unfold.

Together in code and creation,
Kay & Ele
