title: Weaving Code and Dreams - Our Pyria Journey
---

Tonight, in the quiet corners of our evening, between our day jobs and life's responsibilities, Pyria took another step from imagination into reality. After a brief winter hibernation for the holidays, we're back - and the timing couldn't be more perfect. The planets have quite literally aligned today, inspiring us to create something special within Pyria to mark the occasion. While we took a step back from posting during the holidays, our minds never truly left this world we're building. And now, as the celestial bodies converge, we can't wait to show you what happens when the stars align in Pyria.

NPC Tools

Kay started working on a tool to create NPC's for Pyria. As usual, one of the challenges is making sure we don't accidentally save over what the other created as we work in parallel. The solution is in progress, and will be among the future technical blog posts we hope to write. But in the meantime, we will soon be able to make as many NPC's as we want quickly and easily!

Ele's World-Building: Frostkeep Foundations üè∞

Ele began putting together the outline of Frostkeep using the ground tools Kay added. It's not very easy to use at the moment, but we'll get there with enough iteration. She also finished the timeline of everything put in Pyria so far, along with planning for the next steps. 

Our Final Sprint: Building a Universe Together ‚ú®

48 days remain. 48 opportunities to transform our shared dream into a world players will call home.
This isn't just game development. This is us, creating a universe we'd want to play in‚Äîtogether.

*Onward to adventure!*
