title: Time Management & Gerblins: Our Quest to Build Pyria
---


As the clock ticks down, it feels like we're caught in a race against time‚Äîbut it's a race we're determined to win. With just 40 days remaining until the final stretch of our 90-day Pyria journey, every moment matters. And when you have as many layers of life as we do, it means balancing game development, real jobs, health, family time, and, yes, social media posts. In all honesty, sometimes the last thing on our minds is posting updates‚Äîespecially when we're so deep into the work of creating the game.

But, we promise, we're still here! It's just that some things take a back seat when life gets busy. While we haven't posted as frequently lately, we've been making some serious strides behind the scenes. We've been playing the game as we make it, tweaking, testing, and refining to build the world we want to live in (and that we hope others will want to visit).

So, what's new today? A big development: we introduced Gerblins to the world of Pyria‚Äîa classic goblin enemy trope, leaning into a little meme culture. These aren't your average goblins though! Our Gerblins come from the deepest, darkest corners of the Temples' dungeons, caves, and tunnels, adding a much-needed layer of mystery and danger to the game. We love playing with the idea of old-school enemies, but we wanted to do something new and exciting for Pyria. Get ready to meet them soon! And continuously! Since they never stop spawning...

Behind the scenes, Kay has been hard at work on the technical side of things, building the tools we need to make game content like NPCs and Gerblins. But this isn't all about code and assets. Ele's been working on world-building, designing the first version of Frostkeep, a crucial area in the game. We know there's a lot of refining to do before it feels perfect, but we're making progress. We're excited to see it all come together!

In between the game progress, we've also been juggling other projects and responsibilities. Life doesn't stop for game development, right? This week has been full of important milestones and moments:

	‚Ä¢	The Half -Way Mark (January 27)! We honored it by taking our office photos. Coming soon! 

	‚Ä¢	Lunar New Year (January 28) was a time for us to celebrate with family, drawing inspiration from the beauty of the real world and bringing it into Pyria.

	‚Ä¢	Game Time (January 29) kept us engaged and inspired. We even took cues from The Sims when Kay developed a new tool for building structures in Pyria, just for Ele, who loves to play it.	

	‚Ä¢	Keeping Space (January 30) is a mentality we both strive to maintain.  Ele brought a little tidiness to our workspace, which‚Äîtrust us‚Äîmakes a huge difference in our creative flow. 

	‚Ä¢	Logo Design (January 31) has been a creative outlet for both of us. Our game's visual identity is starting to take shape! 

	‚Ä¢	Gerblins (February 1) finally came to life! These bad boys have been waiting around to make their debut since the holidays. We are so stoked to get battle up and running next!

And yes, time management has been on our minds, especially with so much to juggle. Ele's been working on documentation and organizing our processes to keep everything running smoothly. With only 40 days left, it's crucial to stay on top of things and be as efficient as possible. But we also believe in quality over quantity‚Äîthere's a lot more we could be sharing, but we'd rather show you our best work when it's ready.

In the coming days, we're kicking off our first sprint. This means breaking our work into four 10-day blocks, each dedicated to key milestones. It's a fast-paced sprint to the finish, but we're excited to keep pushing forward and to share it all with you.

We can't wait to show you more of what we've been working on. For now, know that behind every line of code and every piece of artwork is a shared dream we're building together. A world we want to play in. Together. Forever.

Onward to adventure!
