title: Tales of Frostkeep
---

Frostkeep - the last bastion of civilization before the endless tundra claims dominion. This frozen city-state is where survival and celebration intertwine in ways that shape every aspect of daily life.

In Frostkeep, the day begins with the Warmth Ritual. As dawn breaks,  mages channel energy through ancient stone glyphs, pushing back the perpetual frost another day. The ritual sustains a microclimate that allows crops to grow in terraced gardens carved into the city's walls - a practical necessity that has become a cherished tradition.

As the warmth generated by the ritual begins to spread, the city stirs to life. Frostkeep’s terraced gardens buzz with activity as farmers tend to hardy crops like frostroot and glacier berries. Workers climb the walls to check for frost damage and rotate the enchanted mirrors that maximize the sunlight.

For Rangers who’ve spent the night outside the city, morning means returning to Frostkeep to resupply and share news of the tundra. Great herds of mammoths, incoming blizzards, or sightings of frost wraiths are all reported to the city’s Wardens, who coordinate the community’s efforts to stay ahead of nature’s challenges.

By midday, Frostkeep is bustling with trade, crafting, and preparation. The city’s forges burn hot as blacksmiths shape weapons, tools, and armor for both local use and export. Skilled artisans carve ice into intricate decorations or practical storage structures, while enchanters imbue equipment to resist cold.

Afternoons in Frostkeep are a time for connection and exploration. The city’s Great Archives, a sprawling repository of northern lore, is a favorite haunt for scholars, mages, and the curious. Here, scrolls detail the history of Frostkeep, from its founding to the legends of the Frozen Wastes, while mages study the volatile properties of the mysterious ice formations that dot the tundra.

As the sun dips below the horizon and the air grows still, the city begins to glow with what locals call the "Lichenflame" - hundreds of blue-burning braziers that cast an ethereal glow across ice-carved architecture. These flames burn without smoke, as they are are fed with special mosses and lichens harvested from deep caves in the frozen wilds.

Merchants set up their stalls in the blue glow, filling the air with the scents of spiced meats, warming stews, and fragrant teas brewed with glacier berries. The second round of Rangers returning from the wilderness bring other exotic goods to trade—rare pelts, enchanted artifacts, and firsthand updates of the tundra’s ever-changing dangers. Artisans display their latest creations, from intricate glass jewelry to enchanted cloaks that shimmer like auroras.

Families and travelers alike gather in the central square, drawn by the warm light and the promise of connection. It’s a time for storytelling, trade, and celebration, but also for strategy—Rangers and Wardens often use this gathering to organize expeditions and plan defenses against any threats looming on the tundra’s edge.

Within the city, relationships deepen as neighbors share meals, trade goods, and prepare for the challenges ahead. The culture of mutual reliance means that even small acts of kindness—repairing a neighbor’s sled or sharing a rare treat—are celebrated and reciprocated.

Visitors to Frostkeep when the first heavy snow falls will discover the tradition of Winter's Welcome, as families open their homes to them, sharing warmth and resources. It's believed that every stranger welcomed during this time brings luck that will last until the spring thaw.
