**Pyria Expands: Castle City, Soundscapes, and the Last Week!**

Hey everyone, it’s Kay & Ele! 🏰✨

One week left. The days are flying by, but today was packed with progress. Pyria is filling up fast, and every detail is making it feel more alive than ever.

**Castle City Comes to Life**

The map of Castle City is finally ready to go! Ele has been hard at work crafting NPCs and locations, and now, there’s a world ready to be filled in and explored even while we build together. Shops, alleys, hidden corners—everywhere you look, there’s something to discover.

**The Sound of Adventure**

Pep has been on a roll, adding even more sounds to Pyria. From the eerie echoes of the dungeon to the bustling energy of Castle City, the world is finding its voice. Every footstep, every spell, every distant roar makes it feel more real.

**The Dungeon Awakens**

Kay has the opening dungeon running smoother than ever. The Cinderhorde still strikes, but now, everything flows seamlessly into the adventure beyond. Every challenge, every detail—it’s all coming together.

**Tomorrow**

There’s even more to show off soon. With just one week left until launch, we’re making every moment count. Pyria is almost ready.

Until next time,
