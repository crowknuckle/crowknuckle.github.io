title: NPC Interactions

Hey everyone, it’s Kay and Ele here with another little update on the ever-growing world of Pyria! It’s been a long week, but we’re excited to share some of the magic we’ve been working on!

**NPCs are Ready to Chat**

Kay’s been diving deep into building out the NPC interaction system. Thanks to his hard work with the new NPC tools, the world of Pyria is now alive with chatter! This is something we’re really excited about because it means the inhabitants of our world can greet you, share tidbits, and help make the world feel real. With this, we’re one step closer to making sure our friends can add themselves to Pyria as we move forward. This is especially exciting because tomorrow marks our first demo and playtest with friends and family!

**The First Demo is Tomorrow!**

It’s a bit surreal that we’re finally at this point. With everything happening so fast, it feels like we’re rushing to the finish line with so much still to do. But we’re making progress! This weekend’s playtest (even if it's not but a demo, we’re trying to pull out all the gears for this first one - this is going to be a big moment for us.) We hope we have enough content to make the exploration and wandering around the world feel immersive, but no matter what, we know the experience will help us refine things. Even with a lot on our plate (like a house full of guests this weekend!) we’re still finding time to focus on Pyria, making sure everything feels just right.

**A World Beyond a Game**

This isn’t just a game to us—it’s a world. A space where we want peace, love, and exploration to be felt in every corner. We’ve poured so much of ourselves into this, and it means everything to us that we’re building a place where we can play together forever. So, as life comes at us full speed this weekend, we’re making sure to embrace it all. Pyria is more than just lines of code; it’s a dream unfolding.

Thank you to all of those following along as we continue to build this magical world. We can’t wait to share more with you!

Until next time,

Kay & Ele
