**Pyria Comes to Life: Sound, NPCs, and the Grand Opening!**

Hey everyone, itâ€™s Kay & Ele! ðŸŽ¶âœ¨

The final countdown is onâ€”March 14 is almost hereâ€”and every day, Pyria is filling with more life, more depth, and more magic.

The World Grows Kay is refining the opening moments, making sure that first step into Pyria is unforgettable. The Cinderhorde still strikes, the Town Square has moved, and more details are coming together to make it all feel real.

Meanwhile, Ele is adding even more NPCs and locations, giving players stories to uncover, places to explore, and characters to meet. Whether itâ€™s a shopkeeper with a sharp tongue or a traveler with a secret, every interaction makes the world richer.

And now, something newâ€”Pyria has sound!

**Enter Pep: The Sound of Pyria**

For the first time, Pyria has its own unique sounds. Pep has joined in, bringing audio to the game. The screams of battle that echo in the dungeon, the magic that stirs in the town square, and the Cinderhordeâ€™s fiery growls that send chills down playerâ€™s spines.
Itâ€™s one thing to see Pyriaâ€”but now, we can hear it.

One Week Left. March 14 is coming fast, but every single day, Pyria gets closer to the world weâ€™ve been dreaming of. The dungeons, the town, the soundsâ€”itâ€™s all coming together.

We canâ€™t wait for you to step inside.


Until next time,
Kay & Ele
