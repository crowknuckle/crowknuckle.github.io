Pyriaâ€™s World is Filling Up!

Hey everyone, itâ€™s Kay & Ele! ðŸŒ¿âœ¨

12 days to launch. Weâ€™re back in the office, deep in the heart of Pyria, and weâ€™re not the only onesâ€”our NPCs are starting to go to work, too!

Bringing Pyria to Life

Ele has been hard at work with an ever-growing list of people and places, filling every corner of Pyria with history, personality, and purpose. Every town, every character, every hidden pathâ€”itâ€™s all starting to feel alive in a way that makes us step back and say, this is real.

Meanwhile, Kay has been building something bigâ€”the Dungeon Maker tool. Dungeons are a crucial part of Pyriaâ€™s adventure, and this tool is making it faster, smoother, and even more fun to create the deep, mysterious places players will explore. Thanks to the tools Kay has built, worldbuilding isnâ€™t just efficientâ€”itâ€™s become an adventure of its own.

The Plan for This Week

With just 12 days left, weâ€™re pushing as much content into the game as possible. We want players to have a rich, exciting place to start when they step into Pyria for the first timeâ€”whether in the upcoming demo or during playtests. Every moment we spend now is making sure Pyria isnâ€™t just a game, but a world worth getting lost in.

Weâ€™re feeling nervous and excited as the final countdown speeds up. Time is running outâ€”but weâ€™re ready. Here we go!

Until next time,
