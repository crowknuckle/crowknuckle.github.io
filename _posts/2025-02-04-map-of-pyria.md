title: Wednesday, Another Day in the Map of Pyria
---

It was a productive and exciting day, though it was a bit of a whirlwind with Ele’s birthday celebration and party prep happening alongside work and game development! We’re getting ready for a weekend of fun, but the progress never stops in the world of Pyria. Especially since this weekend will be our first playtest with family and friends!

**A Link to the Present**

Kay set up more map links to attach the world to Castle City. For easy access, the North Road is connected to the Gerblin Camp  in Helga’s Glade as well as a few other locations. We have also started filling in toward the south and are adjusting the portal mechanics to make them a bit more fun. All this makes it easy for Ele to develop our map in game. Stay tuned for a future post! 

A Quick Look Ahead:

Next up, we’ll be sharing more details about NPC interactions (because they’re always an exciting part of any game!) and the other ways we’re working to bring Pyria to life. We can’t wait to share more soon! But for now, we’re taking a breather as we gear up for some fun with friends and family this weekend.

Until next time,

Kay & Ele
