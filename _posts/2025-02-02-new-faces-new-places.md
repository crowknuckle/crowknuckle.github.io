title: New Faces, New Places & Pyria’s Latest Updates!
---

*February 2, 2025*

Fresh developments to share! So much stuff we’re excited about and can’t wait for others to experience. The world of Pyria is expanding, and with every step, it’s feeling more alive and immersive.

**Meet the Travelers’ Rest Family**

Today, Ele has been weaving a backstory for the family that runs The Traveler’s Tavern, a cozy tavern and inn perched along the long northern road between Castle City and Frost Keep. This is a pivotal spot in Pyria, where adventurers stop for respite, but the family running it has their own secrets—and plenty of quests for you to uncover. Expect deep stories, unexpected twists, and some heartfelt moments as you get to know these characters we’ve built for this world!

**Kay’s Map Update: Gerblins and New Portals!**

On the technical side, Kay has been hard at work improving the navigation on our giant world map. Thanks to Ele, Gerblins now have a full camp to call their own, and thanks to Kay, it’s full of Gerblins!

These mischievous creatures are scattered around Pyria, and their camp promises some serious adventure. Oh, and did we mention there’s a new portal linking different areas of the map? We’ve added a neat little feature to make fast travel even easier. This is just the beginning of the fun new ways to explore the world we’ve been building.

**Gerblins in Action!**

Speaking of Gerblins, we’ve shared a new video showing off our archer battling the Gerblins at their camp. The current spells, abilities, items and combat system are still from the template but we’ll be making those more Pyrian next. But the feel of kiting is pretty close to our target, so check out the video and let us know what you think!

**Looking Back, Moving Forward**

It’s been a productive week, and we’re still going strong! From Ele’s storytelling magic with the Traveler’s Tavern family, to Kay’s technical wizardry with the world map, we’re loving how everything’s starting to come together. Every little piece adds up, and the world of Pyria is slowly becoming the place we’ve always dreamed of playing in together.

With only 39 days left in our 90-day journey, we’re fully in focus mode now trying to build out the approach that makes Pyria such a unique project. We’re breaking our remaining time into focused blocks to keep up the momentum. It’s an exciting, fast-paced stretch to the finish line! Every update, every new feature, and every interaction with you makes this journey feel even more meaningful. So, stay tuned, keep exploring with us, and get ready for more adventures in Pyria!

Onward to adventure!
