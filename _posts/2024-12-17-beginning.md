Yesterday, we named our world. Today, we set foot in it. A real, working copy of Pyria hosted a playtest over the internet.

How did we get there so fast? By transforming developer setup from a potential time sink into a precision instrument.

As of this evening, a single command can spin up a complete Pyria development environment in less time than it takes to brew a pot of coffee.

What used to be a half-day labyrinth of manual configuration is now an automated, reproducible process. No more hunting for obscure dependencies, no more piecemeal setups. In a world where every minute is a precious resource, this investment in automation isn't just efficiency—it's strategy.

Pyria is still raw—"playable" is generous—but the feeling of logging into something real, however small, can’t be overstated.

Tomorrow, we start putting the game together. But today? Today we built the launch pad.
