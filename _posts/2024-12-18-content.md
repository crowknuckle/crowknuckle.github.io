Spent the day importing content packs from the asset store—thousands of pieces spanning everything from foliage and buildings to characters and particle effects. All of these assets are now integrated into our first playable scene, representing many gigabytes of foundational content.

It's a necessary but humbling step. Right now, our world looks like a furniture showroom where someone dumped every display piece into one room. But having these building blocks in place means we can start the real work: curating, culling, and crafting them into something coherent.

The automation we built yesterday proved its worth. What could have been days of manual importing and troubleshooting became a manageable process. There's something satisfying about watching your tools work.

Tomorrow, we'll start making sense of all this raw material. For now, Pyria has stuff in it. It's a start!
