**The Countdown Begins: Pyria’s Final Sprint**


Hey everyone, it’s Kay & Ele! 
February is coming to a close, and every day brings us closer to GDC—and to launching Pyria on Steam! We’re fine-tuning the world, expanding its history, and making sure it’s alive.

What We’ve Been Up To:

Feb 24: Kay refined Pyria’s tools—enemies can now be automatically created, making it easier to fill the world with new dangers and challenges.

Feb 25: Ele continued weaving Pyria’s history while Kay ensured that the pathways around Castle City couldn’t be overrun by rogue bushes (because even in fantasy worlds, infrastructure matters).

Feb 26: PCG-powered rivers are flowing! …Well, shaking for now, but it’s a start.

Feb 27: Viking Day at the office! We feasted like warriors, donned Viking gear, and kept the momentum going. Kay used procedural generation to shape Castle City and its very important Town Square, and Ele dived deeper into its storied past.

Feb 28: We wrapped up the month with a strategy meeting, celebrating our progress and planning our final sprint. And here’s a big one: we officially nailed down Pyria’s core mechanics and defining story—the elements that will make it truly unique. But no spoilers yet! Stay tuned for March.

With only a few days left until March 14, the countdown is on. Every moment counts, and we can’t wait to share what’s next.

Until next time,
Kay & Ele
