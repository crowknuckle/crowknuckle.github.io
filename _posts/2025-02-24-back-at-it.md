**Back At It: Filling Pyria with Life**

Hey everyone, it's Kay & Ele! Time is flying—we’re counting down the days until our deadline, stuffing as much life into Pyria as we can.

Our world is growing fast. NPCs are coming to life thanks to the creative input of our friends, and cities and towns are taking shape at our keyboards. The past few days have been a whirlwind of progress:

-  Feb 20: Kay expanded the weather and day/night systems, while Ele delved into the deep history of Pyria.

-  Feb 21: We had our first themed dinner in our renovated office—because every great adventure needs great food! We used the inspiration to add more fun content to Pyria and our in-game item list is expanding: foods, weapons, rocks (the good stuff).

-  Feb 22–23: Kay Experimented with Dungeon Architect and worked on content implementation, adding even more ways to build towns and built a PCG-volume creating Dungeon that generates fields using the snap-grid system—it’s starting to feel like playing The Sims as we shape city layouts! Meanwhile, Ele is ready to use Kay’s NPC builder tools to bring our friends’ characters to life while continuing to weave the history of Pyria.

There’s still so much to do, and we’re in full-speed-ahead mode. The finish line is in sight, and we’re charging forward!

Until next time,
Kay & Ele
