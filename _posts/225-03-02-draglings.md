**Meet the Draglings â€“ Pyriaâ€™s Most Loyal Companions!**

Hey everyone, itâ€™s Kay & Ele! ðŸŒ¿âœ¨

Itâ€™s Sunday, and that means weâ€™re just 13 days away from launching Pyria on Steam and heading to GDC! The momentum is building, and today, weâ€™re going back to something special: Draglings!

Draglings â€“ Tiny Guardians with Big Hearts

What if you could have a tiny dragon as your best friend? In Pyria, you can! Draglings are the long-lost descendants of dragonkind, bred over generations for their small size, fierce loyalty, and gentle temperament. Standing no taller than a medium-sized dog, theyâ€™ve become beloved companions across the world of Pyria.
Each dragling is attuned to one of the four elemental magicsâ€”fire, water, earth, or airâ€”depending on their origins. This elemental bond shapes their appearance, from shimmering scales that ripple like water to horns crackling with static energy. Though they no longer soar the skies like their dragon ancestors, they are steadfast protectors, always watching over their human with intelligent, affectionate eyes.
Beyond their magical nature, draglings are also a statement of personal style! Whether adorned with gemstone-studded collars, intricate charms, or elegant leashes, they are as much a reflection of their humanâ€™s personality as they are a loyal friend.

What We Worked on Today
ðŸ”¹ Gi joined us in the office! Our third member of Crowknuckle Studios, Gi, is adding more enemies to Pyria, making the world even more dynamic and exciting. 
ðŸ”¹ Deep worldbuilding sessions â€“ We spent hours refining the history of Pyria and how its magic, creatures, and civilizations intertwine. 
ðŸ”¹ More polish, more progress â€“ Every day counts now. Weâ€™re making final refinements, fixing up gameplay elements, and ensuring that Pyria is as immersive as possible before launch.

13 days to go. Weâ€™re in the final sprint, and itâ€™s exhilarating to see everything come together. Thereâ€™s still more to build, more to refineâ€”but Pyria is becoming the world weâ€™ve always dreamed of playing in together.

Until next time, Kay & Ele
