**Into the Fire: Pyriaâ€™s Opening Moments Come to Life!**

Hey everyone, itâ€™s Kay & Ele! âœ¨ðŸ”¥

March 14 is coming fast, and today, something huge happened: Pyriaâ€™s opening sequence is finally in the game! This might be the most important thing weâ€™ve built so farâ€”the moment that welcomes players into our world. And, in true Pyria fashion, it begins with fire.

**Thrown into the Dungeon**

The last day of February, we made a big decision: Pyriaâ€™s adventure would begin in the depths of a dungeon. No introductions, no explanationsâ€”just you, the shadows, and the smoldering threat of the Cinderhorde. These ember-eyed horrors waste no time, swarming you in a fiery onslaught. Whether you fight or fall, the outcome is inevitable: you wake up in town square.

**A Fresh Start
**
You might not remember how you got there... But the world is waiting. A friendly (and very chatty) NPC greets you, nudging you toward your next move. Jump back into the dungeon? Explore the town? Itâ€™s your call.

Thanks to Ele, Pyriaâ€™s world is alive with characters, stories, and places to discover. Thanks to Kay, it all works. Today, code met design in a way that makes Pyria feel realâ€”like a place we want to lose ourselves in, again and again.

Nine Days Left. Thereâ€™s still so much to do, but every moment like this brings us closer to the world weâ€™ve been dreaming of. Every night, every bug fix, every idea is one step toward launch. We canâ€™t wait for you to play.

Until next time, Kay & Ele
