Yesterday, we spoke about magic—the kind that lives in games that truly transport you. Today, that magic has a name: Pyria.

Building Pyria is about reclaiming the spirit that made games feel alive. We’re on an absurdly compressed timeline—90 days from concept to playable reality—and while that might sound impossible, it’s the kind of challenge we live for.

90 days isn’t just a deadline. It’s a forcing function. We don’t have time for perfect. We don’t have time for feature creep. What we do have is talent, experience, and focus. Each day is precious, and this blog holds us accountable. If we’re going to ask you to step into Pyria on March 14th, we’re going to show you the work it takes to get there.

We’re a tiny, all-in team. Microscopically tiny. This game wasn’t in the scope of reality last month. A week ago, it wasn’t even a plan. But some ideas won’t let you walk away. We jumped in, feet first. No funding, no safety nets—just a shared vision, extraordinary tools, and the conviction that this game is possible.

This is only the beginning. Over the coming weeks, we’ll share glimpses of the world, the gameplay, and the systems that will make Pyria unforgettable. There will be challenges. There will be stumbles. But if you’re anything like us, you know those are where the real stories happen.

Day 3 is in the books. Pyria is alive. Tomorrow, we push forward.

88 days to March 14th. Tick tock.
