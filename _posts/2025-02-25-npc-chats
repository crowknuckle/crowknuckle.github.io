**Another Quick Update from Pyria**

We’ve got another brief but exciting update for you!

Kay has been working on a tool that will allow NPCs to interact with each other, the world, and the players. It’s being designed so that we can quickly fill out a large cast of characters, giving them personalities and adding that bit of soul to Pyria that we’re aiming for. We can’t wait to see how it all comes together!

Ele spent the day focusing on social media content and our blog posts (hello, you’re reading one of them now!), but she also found time to work on Castle City. Things are shaping up nicely as we continue to build and refine the world.

We’ll share more details about our new tools tomorrow!

Until next time,
Kay & Ele
