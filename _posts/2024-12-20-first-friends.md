Today, we welcomed our first inhabitant: Helga the Huntress, the inaugural character in what will become a vibrant community.

As our first recruitable NPC, Helga represents the heart of what makes Pyria special. Every character you meet has the potential to become part of your story, bringing their skills, their quirks, and their dreams to your growing community. Convince Helga to make your town her home, and you'll unlock not just hunting skills and quests, but a whole new dimension of gameplay possibilities. Your food stores will grow more plentiful, new events will take place, and relationships will change as her story unfolds in the world you influence.

This weekend, we'll be expanding the characters and stories that make up the world of Pyria. Each NPC we add isn't just a new faceâ€”they're another thread in the fabric of a living, breathing world where every interaction matters and every relationship tells a story.

84 days to March 14th.
