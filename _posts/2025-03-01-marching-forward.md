**Marching Forward: Pyria’s Final Push Begins**

Hey everyone, it’s Kay & Ele! 🌿✨

It’s March, and that means we have just 14 days left before Pyria launches on Steam and we head to GDC! The final stretch is here, and we’re diving in with everything we’ve got.

Ele’s shaping Pyria’s world, Kay’s fine-tuning our tools, and we’re gearing up for something big. 

🔹 Ele spent the day deep in worldbuilding—shaping the history, landscapes, and secrets that make Pyria feel alive. Every corner of this world and character inhabiting it has a story, and we’re making sure players can feel that.
🔹 Kay focused on refining the tools that let us build faster, smoother, and smarter. The better our tools, the richer Pyria becomes.

We’re back at it, ready to carve out big progress, and soon, we’ll have some incredible things to share. But first—there’s work to do. Stay tuned!

14 days to launch. 14 days to GDC. 🎮🚀 No time to waste. We can’t wait to share, but first, we build. 🛠️✨ 

Until next time,
Kay & Ele
