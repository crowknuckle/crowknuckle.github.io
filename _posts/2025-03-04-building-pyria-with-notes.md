**Building Pyria, One Note at a Time!**

Hey everyone, itâ€™s Kay & Ele! âœ¨

11 days to launch. Time is moving fast, and today was all about ideas. So many ideasâ€”more than we have time to build! But instead of getting overwhelmed, weâ€™re focusing on one thing at a time, making sure Pyria stands strong before we start sorting through all the extra details. Hereâ€™s hoping it all works!

**Bringing Order to the Chaos**

Kay built something small but incredibly usefulâ€”developer notes inside the game itself. Now, as we build Pyria, we can drop notes anywhere in the world. To-dos, creative sparks, reminders, or even silly messages to each otherâ€”our workspace just became way more dynamic. When time is short, staying organized is everything!

And thatâ€™s not allâ€”Kay also added chat bubbles! Now NPCs have something to say, from useful hints to complete nonsense. Itâ€™s a little detail that makes a big difference in bringing Pyria to life. Now we just have to decideâ€¦ do we keep their dialogue sensible, or let the chaos take over? ðŸ˜†

Meanwhile, Ele has been working on the NPC and location log, pulling all the pieces together to make sure every character and place has a story to tell. Pyriaâ€™s world is becoming richer by the day, and even though thereâ€™s still so much to do, we can feel it coming together.

**The Final Stretch**

With just 11 days left, weâ€™re racing toward the finish line. We know there will always be more to add, more to refine, more ideas we wish we had time forâ€”but right now, the goal is clear: get Pyria on its legs and into your hands. One step at a time, one note at a time, weâ€™re making it happen.

Until next time, Kay & Ele
