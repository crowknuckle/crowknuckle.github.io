**Cinderhorde Rising: A Day of Lore & Dungeons!**

Hey everyone, itâ€™s Kay & Ele! ðŸ”¥âœ¨

10 days to launch. The countdown is speeding up, but today we took a moment to step back, celebrate, and, of course, keep creating.

**A Birthday and a Bestiary Update**

We took a small break from the office to celebrate Pepâ€™s birthday, but that didnâ€™t stop the ideas from flowing! Ele and Pep spent time expanding the Dragling lore, filling the idea bank with even more details that will bring Pyriaâ€™s creatures to life.

Meanwhile, Kay stayed behind to test the randomly generated dungeons, and theyâ€™re shaping up beautifully. Each run feels fresh, unpredictable, andâ€”most importantlyâ€”challenging. But whatâ€™s a dungeon without terrifying monsters? Thatâ€™s where Gi comes in!

**Enter the Cinderhorde**

Pyriaâ€™s newest nightmare is here: the Cinderhorde. These smoldering horrors lurk in the dungeon depths, hunting in swarms. Their cracked obsidian hides glow from within, embers flickering beneath jagged claws and horns. Their eerie, ember-filled eyes burn with relentless hunger, and when they strike, itâ€™s in an overwhelming fiery onslaught, reducing everything in their wake to ash and ruin.

If you thought Pyriaâ€™s dungeons were just about treasure huntingâ€”think again. Survival is just as important.

**The Final Countdown**

With only 10 days left, weâ€™re feeling the pressure, but also the excitement. Thereâ€™s so much left to do, but every day brings Pyria closer to the world weâ€™ve been dreaming of. Letâ€™s make these last days count!

Until next time,

Kay & Ele
